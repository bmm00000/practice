https (hyper text transfer protocol secure): the 'language' client and server speak. secure means that the communication is encrypted (the browser authomatically adds 'https://...' when you enter the url)

IP (Internet Protocol) address: a unique identifier of network devices for establishing connections and talking with each other. domains are more readible by humans, but are not used to establish connections and sending requests, although if you knew the IP address of a website, you can use it insted of using the domain and it would work (all devices that are part of the internet need an IP address, but for example, your computer, if it's not hosting a website, doesn't have a humanly readible domain; every device has an IP address, but not every device has a domain, that's why we use IP addresses to establish conections). that's why we have special servers, operated by global organizations: DNS servers (domain name system). these servers contain translation tables between domains and ip addresses that belong to these domains (the ip addresses of the remote computers that host the websites that belong to certain domains).

when you enter a url in your browser, your browser first talks to a DNS server to translate the domain into an ip address, and then once the ip address was returned, then your browser sends the request to that remote machine (the server identified with the ip address that is serving that website)
