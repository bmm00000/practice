url: uniform resource locator

https (hyper text transfer protocol secure): the 'language' client and server speak. secure means that the communication is encrypted (the browser authomatically adds 'https://...' when you enter the url)

IP (Internet Protocol) address: a unique identifier of network devices for establishing connections and talking with each other. domains are more readible by humans, but are not used to establish connections and sending requests, although if you knew the IP address of a website, you can use it insted of using the domain and it would work (all devices that are part of the internet need an IP address, but for example, your computer, if it's not hosting a website, doesn't have a humanly readible domain; every device has an IP address, but not every device has a domain, that's why we use IP addresses to establish conections). that's why we have special servers, operated by global organizations: DNS servers (domain name system). these servers contain translation tables between domains and ip addresses that belong to these domains (the ip addresses of the remote computers that host the websites that belong to certain domains).

when you enter a url in your browser, your browser first talks to a DNS server to translate the domain into an ip address, and then once the ip address was returned, then your browser sends the request to that remote machine (the server identified with the ip address that is serving that website)

even though your computer has an ip address (if connected to the internet), you don't have to worry that other user will access it, since typically it doesn't allow incoming external traffic from other users. to host a website, appropriate 'entry points' (Ports) must be opened in the network and your computer must be configured as a web server.

A lot of websites can be visited via different domains. For example, the Amazon website can be visited via amazon.com but also via www.amazon.com. Both addresses can be entered in the browser and you will reach the same website.

So what's the difference?

Especially in the earlier days of the internet, it was also often called the "world wide web" (or: "www"). You still hear that term quite a bit and it's this term, that explains why some websites support such a "www" prefix in the domain.

Technically, www.amazon.com is called a "subdomain" of the "root domain" amazon.com. As the operator of a website and the owner of a domain, you can register any subdomains you want to. You could also register mysite.amazon.com, if you were the owner of the amazon.com domain. And you can then configure your web server such, that your website is served, if users enter mysite.amazon.com.

That's what many (but not all) websites do with the "www" subdomain: They register it and configure it such, that it also points at the main website.

It's not required and not all websites have it. Most users also don't type "www.somewebsite.com" manually anymore - instead just the root domain is entered in many cases.

the different html tags give different instructions to the browser (what content has to be a header, a paragraph, etc.)

html is a markup language: a language that is there to add up some extra annotation/meaning/description to the content that you have in your page.

html instructs the browser about content, its structure and its meaning.
