you may not want to add the 'redux' and 'react-redux' libraries as dependencies to your project, because you may want to end up with a smaller bundle, so you will ship less code when you deploy your application (although if you are deploying a large application, it will not matter that much if you include those libraries or not).

regarding performance, the context api is not really optimized: the way it works is such that, whenever something changes in your contexts, it has no way of quickly figuring out which component that uses this context is concerned and which component is not, which means that every component that uses useContext will re-render when you change something in the context, no matter if the component is directly affected or not. therefore, the context api is meant to manage some states of low frequency change, such as authentication, themes, etc., but not for all your state.
