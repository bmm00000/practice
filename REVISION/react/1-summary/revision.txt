1- SAME DAY: build projects to re-build in the future, take notes to re-read, take note of videos or sections to re-watch, note in anki?
if needed, compare with code in repos after I build projects on my own:
https://github.com/academind/react-complete-guide-code
https://github.com/academind/js-testing-practical-guide-code/tree/main

re-watch from 495-understanding and adding routing.

2- ANOTHER DAY (check anki?): re-build, and then compare with my old code, and also check slides in repos above.
