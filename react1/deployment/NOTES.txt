we can do lazy loading in order to optimize our code.

when we build, we execute a script that was written for us already (it's part of the react set up), and this script will output a production-ready bundle of our code, which is minified and optimized to be as small as possible, so we can take this output and move it to a server, so the server will serve our users a highly optimized code package that is as small as possible, which matters a lot because we want to ship as little code as possible to our users, because they will only be able to interact with our website once it's fully loaded, so shipping less code will load the app faster, and therefore the app will be better.
