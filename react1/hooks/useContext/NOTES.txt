with the help of context, you can not only pass down state values, but also functions (to update state)

when you create the auth-context.js file, you don't name it AuthContext.js becuase it would imply that we are creating a component, and we are not doing that.

you can have multiple contexts for multiple global states, or you can use one context for a bigger state, that's up to you

we can listen for context in two ways: in our case: we can use AuthContext.Consumer, or by using a the useContext hook (we will typically use the react useContext hook because the syntax is more elegant).
