you never put in your frontend facing js code private information that gives direct access to your firebase account (for example, usernames, passwords, etc.). for other data that only grant access to your api, but not to your account (eg. api keys), you might want to set up some filtering settings in firebase, so you restrict/authorize access from some ip addresses, etc. and it's not that bad. but in any case, you can always put it into the server side code, so it's not accessible at all from the frontend.
in a nushell, is it a problem that people can read your js code in the browser dev tools sources tab? yes, they can read it, but if you do it right, they can't do anything with it. and if you are worried about people stealing your logic, yes they can do it, but the production code is very hard to read, and also, your core business logic will always be on the server.
