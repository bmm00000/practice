in phase 1, requirements will be gathered by discussing with stakeholders and users (gathered, documented, revised, and approved).

phase 2: based on requirements, and based on design principles, best practices, architectural principles, the software is going to be designed or architected to satisfy the requirements

phase 4: quality control or quality assurance phase. it will be verified whether or not the software meets the requirements, and spot defects that took places in phases 2 or 3. In this phase there are different kinds of tests (unit testing, integration testing, user acceptance testing, performance testing)

phase 5: the software will be put in an environment or a place that the user can access. this is the process of moving the software from within the organization to the end user.

phase 6: users report any bugs, these will be fixed, and users will test again. the software will be in this phase for more time than in any other phase.

for each phase, we will see:
goals, roles of people involved, processes, deliverables

PHASE 1:

difference between project and system : project will have definite start and definite end, whereas a system can be in maintenance mode so it won't have a definite end.

project manager is like a coordinator, leader, accountable, responsible person for the project in all the phases

The product manager owns the product vision and defines what the ideal customer experience should be, based on a deep understanding of customer needs. The product owner works with the development team to ensure that the right experience is being built. And the project manager focuses on all the cross-functional work, driving on-time and on-budget schedules. Here are a few more ways to think about the three roles:

Purpose
The product manager sets the product vision and strategy. This role defines the release process and identifies the cross-functional activities necessary to bring the product (or feature) to market. This work is not one-and-done — it continues through the entire lifecycle of a product.
In other words, product managers are not responsible for a specific project or team. They are responsible for one or more of a company’s products. This means from ideation until, well, forever.

The product owner supports the development team by prioritizing the product backlog and creating user stories. They serve as an internal customer expert for engineering and development teams, answering questions and clarifying requirements.

(A product backlog is a list of the new features, changes to existing features, bug fixes, infrastructure changes or other activities that a team may deliver in order to achieve a specific outcome. The product backlog is the single authoritative source for things that a team works on.)

program manager:
Whereas a product manager generally focuses straight ahead on all the elements needed to drive her products forward strategically, a program manager takes a lateral view across the organization.
Program management involves identifying and coordinating the interdependencies among projects, products, and other important strategic initiatives across an organization.

The project manager oversees the project and ensures that deadlines are met. They manage all of the cross-functional work that is required to deliver a Complete Product Experience. This role is also internally focused, coordinating complex work across many teams and many dependencies.

So how is a program manager different from a project manager? The typical difference is that program management is more of a strategic-level responsibility. At the same time, project management is more tactical.
In many organizations, part of a program manager’s responsibility will be to provide strategic guidance and direction to project managers. They will identify an interdependency, for example, between the product team and marketing. Then they will guide project management in breaking down this cross-functional initiative. This is so the project managers can construct the specific tasks they’ll need to track.

Product Management vs. Program Management:
Because product management is responsible for the product’s success (or failure) in the market, a product manager will primarily concern herself by answering the question, “Why?” Why build the product this way, why target this user persona, why prioritize this functionality over that, why set our prices at this level?
By contrast, program management requires taking more of an organization-wide view of any strategic initiative. This includes the development of a product. This means a program manager will be primarily concerned with “How?” and “When?” questions. How can we carve out enough time and personnel from customer support to conduct pre-launch product training? When do we need to start the marketing department working on collateral creation? How much budget can we allot to these initiatives?

The Scrum Master doesn’t manage the team that produces the work, instead he supports the Product Owner, coaches the team and makes sure that Scrum processes are adhered to. The Scrum Master is responsible for the Scrum process, its correct implementation, and the maximization of its benefits.
