in phase 1, requirements will be gathered by discussing with stakeholders and users (gathered, documented, revised, and approved).

phase 2: based on requirements, and based on design principles, best practices, architectural principles, the software is going to be designed or architected to satisfy the requirements

phase 4: quality control or quality assurance phase. it will be verified whether or not the software meets the requirements, and spot defects that took places in phases 2 or 3. In this phase there are different kinds of tests (unit testing, integration testing, user acceptance testing, performance testing)

phase 5: the software will be put in an environment or a place that the user can access. this is the process of moving the software from within the organization to the end user.

phase 6: users report any bugs, these will be fixed, and users will test again. the software will be in this phase for more time than in any other phase.

for each phase, we will see:
goals, roles is involved, process, deliverables
