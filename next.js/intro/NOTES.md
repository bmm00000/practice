imperative approach: code every single action, for example, when you are coding all the interactivity in javascript, not using a library.

declarative, component-focused approach: higher level syntax that you code when using a library.

built step: the code that you write is not the code that will end up in the browser. the code that you write will be transformed behind the scenes before it reaches the browser. This is what happens behind the scenes with React (the browser does not render jsx)
