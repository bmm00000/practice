AUTHOMATIC GLOBAL SCOPE:
if we assign a value to a variable that has not been declared, it becomes a global variable authomatically. For example, see screenshot. So WATCH OUT! you always need to declare the variables you are using inside your functions, or they will become global variables authomatically.

IN THE BROWSER, THE GLOBAL OBJECT IS THE WINDOW OBJECT.
any variables we create in the global scope will be attached to the window object (see screenshot)

WHEN THE KEYWORD this IS USED INSIDE OF A DELCARED OBJECT, the value of 'this' is set to the closest parent object the method is called on.
