a very standard name for remotes is 'origin'

when you create a new repo in github, it doesn't have content, only the instructions (screenshot). when you push for the first time, then it gets the content

when you push a branch to origin, you don't need to be on that branch, although that's what happens more often than not.

QUESTION:
does'git push' work when you only have one remote ('origin') and one branch ('main')?
